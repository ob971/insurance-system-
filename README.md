The Insurance System is a MERN stack project developed for a school project. It allows new users to sign up and existing users to log in, providing authentication and authorization functionality. The system also includes payment integration for processing payments. 

The frontend of the system is built using React and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. The backend utilizes Express, which is a Node.js framework, to handle server-side logic and API requests. 

For data storage, the system uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store user information and other relevant data. MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

Overall, the Insurance System is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing user accounts, authentication, authorization, and payment processing within the insurance domain. It serves as a practical demonstration of the MERN stack technology stack in a real-world application.
